# neural_Lyapunov

This repo constructs the Lyapunov candidate based on neural network.


## Step 1. Show the tracking error.


Plot the tracking error, e(t).



## Step 2. Visualize the reference velocity and the actual velocity.


Plot (dr1,dr2) and (dx1,dx2) diagrams.


## Step 3. Find the Lyapunov Candidate using Neural Network.
